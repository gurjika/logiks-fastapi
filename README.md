## üõ† Architecture Overview

- **FastAPI** app running on EC2 instances behind an **Auto Scaling Group** and **Elastic Load Balancer** (ALB).
- **Amazon RDS** for relational database storage (metadata persistence).
- **Amazon S3** for storing artifacts.
- **AWS CodePipeline** for CI/CD, pulling source code from **GitHub** and deploying updates automatically.

## üìö CRUD Endpoints

The following basic book management endpoints are available:

- `GET /books`: Retrieve all books.
- `POST /books`: Create a new book.
- `GET /books/{id}`: Retrieve a book by ID.
- `PUT /books/{id}`: Update a book by ID.
- `DELETE /books/{id}`: Delete a book by ID.
